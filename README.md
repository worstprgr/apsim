# AP SIM [WIP]
Simulates the air pressure in a room

## Private Notes
### Parameter
- Listener Height = 170 m
- Room Height = $int m
- Room Width = $int m
- Room Depth = $int m
- Stage Width = $int m
- Stage Depth = $int m
- Units: DBa
- Sonic Sources = y, x
- Listeners = y, x
- Distance (m) between each source and listeners
- Current Air Pressure at sea level = 760 mmHg (int) or 1,013.25 hPa (float)

#### Further Notes & Reference
> [...] the SPL decreases by 6 decibels (dB) for every doubling of the distance from the source. 
> For example, if the SPL of a sound wave at a distance of 1 meter is 80 dB, 
> it will be 74 dB at a distance of 2 meters, 68 dB at a distance of 4 meters, and so on.
